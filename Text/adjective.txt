You can try and battle me, but you're too
I make the MCs in the place wish that they were
My rhymes blow your mind and you think it's
My sweet-ass rhymes make your girl feel
Now I'm gonna tell you why you ain't
You'll never beat me 'cause I'm so
If you're gonna battle me, then you gotta be
When I rock a mic you know I rock it real
If a rapper tries to step I'm gonna get
When I'm on the stage the ladies get
I'm smooth, you'll never catch me acting
Try and step to me I have to laugh, it's so
My style tried and tested, guaranteed most
Way I rock the mic you know I'm born
See you try to rhyme, it come out just so
I'm the greatest MC, internationally
